# AdaAfford: Learning to Adapt Manipulation Affordance for 3D Articulated Objects via Few-shot Interactions

![Overview](/images/adagif.gif)

We propose a novel framework, named AdaAfford, that learns to perform very few test-time interactions for quickly adapting the affordance priors to more accurate instance-specific posteriors.

## Dependencies

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Cuda 10.1, Python 3.6, and PyTorch 1.7.0.

First, install SAPIEN following

    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

For other Python versions, you can use one of the following

    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp35-cp35m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

Please do not use the default `pip install sapien` as SAPIEN is still being actively developed and updated.

Then install PointNet++ as we need to process the point cloud.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch
    cd Pointnet2_PyTorch
    # [IMPORTANT] comment these two lines of code:
    #   https://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch/blob/master/pointnet2_ops_lib/pointnet2_ops/_ext-src/src/sampling_gpu.cu#L100-L101
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .

The other requirements could be installed directly by pip install.

For visualization, please install blender v2.79 and put the executable in your environment path.
Also, the prediction result can be visualized using MeshLab or the *RenderShape* tool in [Thea](https://github.com/sidch/thea).
